# PrayerTimeClock

Small fun project that I wanted to try out, because I also needed a clock that shows the prayer times. 
The code is not exactly clean and efficient and would need to be refactored, I threw it together relatively quickly. Currently it does what it's supposed to, so I think I'll continue working on it at a later date.
